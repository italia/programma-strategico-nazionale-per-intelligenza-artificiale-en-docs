Strategic Areas of Intervention and policies
============================================

The six objectives laid out in the previous section define the goals of this strategic programme. The eleven priority
sectors define where Italy intends to invest the most. This section, which lays out the areas of interventions, defines
how this strategy aims to achieve the stated objectives in the priority sectors.

**There are three key areas of policy intervention:**

In the following sections, this strategy will develop on these areas of 
intervention and describe the specific policies the Government envisions. 

Talent and skills
-----------------

AI has a transformative impact on all aspects of our society, and the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this trend.
The 2020 World Economic Forum estimates that by 2025 85 million jobs may be displaced by a shift in the division
of labour between humans and machines, while 97 million new roles may emerge. This transition will have significant distributional effects both across and within 
countries. 

To mitigate the effects of such a transition (e.g., unemployment in certain segments of the population) and at the
same time ensure that Italy remains on the edge of the technological frontier, the country needs to invest holistically
in AI training and skills development for citizens. On the one hand, therefore, the country needs to invest in being at
the forefront of AI research. This means expanding and improving the PhD programmes and attracting/retaining top
researchers. On the other, Italy must ensure that the whole economy takes advantage of the productivity opportunities inherent in the diffusion of AI. Thus, it 
needs to strengthen the STEM component of the broader educational system, in order to support the development of a workforce that can interact with AI and 
exploit its benefits.

**A1. Strengthening the National PhD Program**

**This measure aims at consolidating and expanding Italian PhD programmes overall, with the ambition of assigning an
appropriate share to AI.**

**Objective**

To consolidate and expand PhDs to train a larger share of local students to AI and attract high-quality
students from abroad.

**Initiatives**

-  Increasing the number of PhDs. The target is set largely to make up for the loss in PhD fellowships
   suffered in recent years, as an intermediate step towards a further extension in numbers in the long
   term

Research
--------

As shown in chapter 1, the Italian research ecosystem shows signs of strength, yet its fragmentation, lack of resources and low patenting rhythm impede its
effectiveness. To address these challenges, this section illustrates policies
that aim to bridge the gap between foundational and applied research by fostering collaborations between academia,
industry, public bodies and society. The future of AI necessarily implies a strong synergy among public and private
research centres, industrial research and innovation centres, start-ups and SMEs, and target users’ domain expertise.

Research programme initiatives are divided into two classes:

**B.** Building the Italian AI research ecosystem: fundamental and applied research. 

**C.** Horizontal aspects.

developed by the research communities, particularly those established
within the ESFRI Road map.

Applications
------------

As evidenced in the introductory chapters, the Italian AI ecosystem suffers from low patenting and a slow technology
transfer process. In addition, Italian firms, large and small, have so far been slow to adopt AI solutions resulting in an
AI market of limited size. 

To address these challenges, this strategy proposes a set of policies aimed at broadening the breadth of AI application in industries and society, as well as 
measures to foster the birth and growth of innovative AI enterprises. In addition, these policies are meant to insist on priority areas and accompany the growth 
of sectors that have so far shown potential in AI development and adoption.

All initiatives share common issues and targets: 

-  To pay particular attention to smaller companies, those operating in the most peripheral and disadvantaged geographical or socioeconomic contexts, focusing on    the priority sectors (Section 2.3) and on national strategic sectors (Critical Infrastructures, sectors defined in “Decreto Golden Power”).

-  To increase the number of female AI entrepreneurs and experts, as well as attracting foreign AI-based start-ups and practitioners with economic incentives to    be applied in all of the initiatives outlined below.

-  To align all AI policies related to data processing, aggregation, sharing and exchange, as well as data security with the National Strategy for Cloud and with    the initiatives underway at EU level, starting with the European Data Strategy and the recent proposal for a Data Governance Act and AI Act. 

To that end, this strategy identifies two areas of intervention that we deem to be of highest impact as well as most
strategic. 

**D.** AI for more modern enterprises.

**E.** AI for a more modern public administration.

**D.AI for more modern enterprises.**

The impact of AI on businesses will be of enormous relevance and should concern all enterprises. In fact, AI implies a
real revolution in their modus operandi, from internal processes and customer relations to the development of new
AI-based products and services. In turn, AI implies that Italian corporates would need to transform their workforce as
well as processes, hiring new talent, upskilling the existing workforce and making sure such transition is carried out
with the most effective and responsible use of AI solutions. 

Overall, the proposed initiatives aim at:

-  Supporting the hiring process of highly skilled AI personnel in private companies, so as to reinforce their 4.0 Transitions process (machinery, HW, SW and people),

-  Increasing the adoption of AI solutions in private companies, so as to increase their competitiveness, 

-  Helping start-ups and spin-offs to scale up, avoid the “valley of death” and support their national and international growth,

-  Establishing a regulatory context that may help the experimentation and the certification of reliable AI products and services that have passed such experimentation.

Therefore, this strategy supports the following initiatives:

**D1. Making AI a pillar that supports enterprises' Transition 4.0**

**Objective**

To stimulate the transition towards a knowledge based economy; to increase the intensity of R&D expenditure compared to GDP; [7]_; to curb the substantial and 
lasting loss of technical scientific talents, especially young people; to improve the intellectual protection of AI solutions for better competitiveness of enterprises.

**Possible initiatives**

Introduction of clear guidelines on AI experts salaries [8]_ which should be in line with international salary
benchmarks,

With regard to the recruiting of senior AI experts, promotion of double appointment positions through
incentives for all the parties involved,

Introduction of tax credit or vouchers for the recruitment of STEM profiles,

Updating the list of software and hardware expenses that are eligible for Transition 4.0 incentives, [9]_.

Leveraging the existing successful initiatives that offer educational training by academic and industrial
partners, a second level Master Degree for participants and a clear path towards employment where
needed [10]_.

It is recommended to begin the implementation (Y1-Y2) through a couple of priority sectors - Industry &
manufacturing and Banking, finance & insurance - as data indicates these are the sectors where the measure may have the largest impact. In addition to these sectors, National Security and Information technologies
should also be considered. From Y2-Y3, all Priority sectors should be added. 

**D2. Supporting the growth of innovative spin-off and start-ups**

**Objective**

To increase the number of AI start-ups by 30% with respect to 2021; to improve the average revenues of
AI start-ups by 50% in the domestic market and 30% in export; to improve the number of scale-ups; to
detect and support scale-ups and unicorns.

**Initiative**

Fostering talents as start-up founders: supporting entrepreneurship education for children/youngsters, encouraging university students to start a business, 
supporting female entrepreneurs, ensuring
equal innovation opportunities, scale-up fair.

Fostering collaboration within start-up ecosystems: offering public procurement to start-ups for
purchasing goods and services, fostering open innovation, fostering spin-offs, co-creating flagship
projects to connect start-up ecosystem players, fostering tax incentives for growth.

research centres to experiment with their own innovative project for a limited period of time through a
temporary exemption from the rules in force under art 36 DL 76/2020. This specific instrument facilitates
the access of corporates, spin-offs, start-ups, research bodies, universities, higher technical institutes
and technology transfer centres to authorised controlled experimentation for testing AI technologies
under real or close to real conditions with regulatory exceptions of limited duration and perimeter, prior to
their potential introduction on the market. 

**Recommended sectors**

All Priority sectors.

**D4. Supporting enterprises in AI Product Certification**

**Objective**

To increase by 30% the number of EU-certified AI products and services from enterprises in sectors where
EU certifications already exist.

**Initiative**

Definition of a national governance system (referring as much as possible to existing national institutions and authorities in the sector) supporting the c
ertification of AI products (with higher risk profiles, in
particular to health, safety or rights) going to the market with the definition of clear harmonised tools in
line with the new proposal for a Regulation on artificial intelligence issued by the European Commission
on 21 April 2021 (COM (2021) 206). In the health sector, a close collaboration will be warranted between
the Italian government system and technical / scientific bodies at European level, called upon to provide
detailed technical indications for the implementation of the rules, both of the future AI Regulation and of
the Medical Device Regulation, i.e. the Regulations EU 745 and 746/2017 (the first became fully applicable on May 26, 2021), so that all the appropriate 
corrective measures are adopted. The goal is to ensure that the two regulations are coherent and well coordinated with each other, to the benefit of the
development of the AI sector.

**Recommended sectors:**

All priority sectors.

**D5.  Promoting AI information campaigns for enterprises**

**Objective**

To promote communication and awareness-raising campaigns on the benefits of AI products and
services by reaching at least 80% of trade associations, 30% of trade association members, 80% of
Competence Centres and Digital Innovation Hubs.

**Initiative**

Organisation of 20 communication and awareness actions on AI. The campaign will include the dissemination of the National Strategic Programme for AI to 
entrepreneurs and managers of interested enterprises through a coordinated action with trade associations, Competence Centres and Digital Innovation
Hubs. The campaign will also focus on the risks and obligations for marketing AI products and services
under national and European legislation, especially in the context of the upcoming European regulation on
AI.

**E.  AI for a more modern Public Administration**

The transition to new technological paradigm based on AI will strongly affect the public administration. Indeed,
thanks to AI, the Italian PA has the opportunity to embrace a modernisation process that can no longer be avoided.
The use of AI allows public administrations to adapt and customise the supply of specific services and in general
exploit the big-data generated within the PA to expand the public sector’s services and the opportunities for 
integration with firms (e.g., in healthcare, 
mobility), in line with privacy regulations.

The public administration can become a real driver of AI development, thanks to the data it produces and to its role
as a more potential purchaser of innovative goods or services. Consequently, it is essential to make existing data
usable by public administrations, in accordance with GDPR regulations, the principles of *privacy by design, ethics by
design and human-centred design*, and by creating forms of data aggregation (e.g. data lake). At the same time, the
availability of data is a necessary but not sufficient condition for designing a new PA. To do so, it needs to be equipped
with appropriate skills, procedures and tools. 

To this end, we propose the following initiatives for the promotion of AI *within* the PA and *for* the PA: 

**E1. Creating integrated datasets for Open Data and Open AI Models**

**Objective**

To ensure common standards in terms of form, structure and granularity on Data and AI Software and
Services as well as compliance protocols with national and EU regulations. To favour the development of
advanced analysis and/or software solutions that exploit the enormous big data potential of the PA from
its interactions with citizens.

**Initiative**

Integrating the various PA data feeds to make them highly interoperable, open to private companies for
AI-software development but also to be used in the design and implementation phase of new algorithms,
new learning models and AI systems released by the different administrations and open to be reused, with
regard for the trustworthiness issues of national and EU regulations and in compliance with the rules for
the protection of personal data. In addition, regularly updating the guidelines for reusable Open Data for AI
models with extensively large and annotated datasets (e.g. data for smart mobility). Policies will be the
basis for Italian Participation in the Common European Data Space of the PA, envisaged by the European
Data Strategy. This will be done jointly with the implementation of already existing standards alongside
the establishment of reward mechanisms for individual PA managers based on the compliance of their
data structure and AI-based services with the indicated criteria.

**E2. Strengthening AI solutions in the PA and the GovTech ecosystem in Italy**

**Objective**

To develop AI solutions matching the needs outlined in the priority actions linked to the PA and public
sectors, namely: 1) digitalisation and modernisation of public administration; 2) protection of land and
water resources; 3) road maintenance 4.0; 4) telemedicine, innovation and digitalisation of healthcare.
Support the development of an Italian GovTech start-up ecosystem.

**Initiative**

Introduction of periodic calls to identify and support start-ups with potential AI-based solutions to PA’s
pain points, through an accelerator-like programme that turns ideas/research projects into applicable
solutions and scalable companies. CITD [11]_  periodically identifies, through a technical committee of experts
supported by ministerial staff, well-defined key challenges for the PA that could also represent large
revenue opportunities for solutions suppliers (e.g. AI for simplifying and accelerating the management of
public procurement contracts and related guarantees). Challenges are published and a professionally run
accelerator partner develops acceleration programmes revolving around the challenges. MITD ensures
that innovative procurement offers possibility for PA contracts after acceleration and supports start-ups
in abiding to European AI and data regulation.

**Investment**

Il comitato tecnico del MITD valuta il raggiungimento degli obiettivi da
parte delle start-up e assegna premi per le prime tre aziende che
raggiungono ciascun obiettivo. L’acceleratore partner, in coordinamento
con il comitato tecnico del MITD [12]_, esegue la prima selezione delle
start-up e fornisce il finanziamento iniziale, il mentoring e l'accesso
a investitori di venture capital.

**E3. Creating a common Italian language resource dataset for AI development**

**Objective**

To ensure that researchers, businesses and public administration have access to a high-quality shared
language resource (very-large datasets of Italian language documents on which AI language models can
be trained), thus increasing Italian competitiveness in the field as well as the AI-based solutions available
for Italian citizens.

**Initiative**

Creation of an open and shared language resource structured collection of digital datasets of Italian documents available to everyone for free through a 
collaboration between both public and private players. This
resource will collect text files, sound files, and terminology banks, which can be used to develop text
mining, chatbots, conversational interfaces, multilingual translation, text generation or other services
improving both public and private services. The initiative will effectively help bridge the scale gap between
aspiring Italian AI companies/services and larger international tech companies that have access to their
own private databases.

**E4. Creating datasets and AI/NLP based analytics for feedback and service improvement in PA**

**Objective**

To improve the quality of in-person and digital interactions of citizens with the PA.

**Initiative**

Create annotated anonimised dataset of citizens-PA interactions (online activity but also feedback from
in-person interactions, e.g. from the National Institute for Social Security known as INPS) to support the
development or integration of AI tools/technology providers to develop new services of conversational
interfaces, sentiment analysis, pain-points detection and prediction and support employers to identify
possible solutions. Create specific calls for providing scalable solutions at national level for the PA.

**E5. Creating datasets and AI/Computer Vision based analytics for service improvement in PA**

**Objective**
 
To support the PA in extracting knowledge from digitized visual documents, video and satellite images.

**Initiative**

Create a very large annotated dataset of satellite images of urban and environmental landscapes, digitized land registry images, urban and suburban video for 
mobility 5.0 applications, and support specific calls to provide computer vision solutions with open source code or software licensed for PA use. Potential 
applications could be a) land registry categorization, anomaly identification in land registry, recognition of cadastral anomalies versus urban planning data, b) 
satellite images of urban and suburban areas to support construction sectors and infrastructure monitoring, c) satellite data and urban camera video of
national roads for short-term and long-term traffic prediction.

**E6.  Introducing cross-authority case processing**

**Objective**

To improve the quality of service centres for citizens and simplify the problem-solving process in a more
efficient way by reducing case processing time.

**Initiative**

Introduce AI-based technologies to automate the sorting and preparation of inquiries for processing. For
instance, automation will involve: screening, comparison, categorisation and decision support in case
processing; automatic comparison of textual/visual digitized documents; robotic process automation
(RPA); supporting PA employers in standard answers. Hence, case officers will be able to concentrate on
the most critical cases. Optimisation with case processing is relevant for various authorities, such as the
citizen service centres and the subsidies administration area.

TAll the initiatives for the applications of AI to the PA will be funded predominantly via PCM [13]_-MITD/PA resources, in
partnership with other public/private institutions where relevant.
