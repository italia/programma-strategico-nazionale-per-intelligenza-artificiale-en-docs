The anchoring: an EU centred AI
-------------------------------------

Over the last decade, industry and society have been radically changed by the ongoing digital revolution. In this
context, the EU has recognized **AI as an area of strategic importance** with the potential of becoming a key driver of
economic development.

In April 2018, the European Commission put forward a European strategy on 
AI in its Communication ‘Artificial Intelligence for Europe’ COM(2018)237 a
s part of its Digital Single Market Strategy. This strategy delineates the following
aims: 

-  .. rubric:: Boosting the EU's **AI technological and industrial leadership** and AI uptake across the economy, both in the private and public sectors.

-  .. rubric:: Preparing for **socio-economic changes** brought about by AI.

-  .. rubric:: Establishing an appropriate **legal framework** based on ethical values and principles. 

Following this, the European Commission and the Member States put forward a ‘Coordinated Plan 
on Artificial Intelligence’ - COM(2018)795 in December 2018 with the stated goal of maximizing AI investments' impact both at
European and national levels and strengthening synergies and cooperation among Member States. To this end,
**Member States were strongly encouraged** to develop their own national AI strategies as a first step to achieve
these aims. *This strategic programme responds to this encouragement.*

More recently, the EU Commission published the ‘2021 review of the Coordinated Plan 
on Artificial Intelligence’ with a view to strengthen Member States’ competitive landscapes. 
The review reports actions taken by the European Commission so far within the framework of 
the MFF 2021-2027 programming and sets concrete proposals and
recommendations for further joint actions between the EU and Member States. 
The plan was accompanied by significant investments: €1.5 billion (2018-2020) 
and €1 billion/year (after 2020) to be allocated in the following funding
framework programmes [1]_.

.. _section-5:

To support the implementation of the plan outlined above, the European Commission launched the project “AI Watch”
in 2019, with the goal of monitoring industrial, technological and research capacity, as well as national 
policy initiatives. Furthermore, the project keeps track of updates and technological developments of AI worldwide, 
assesses their impact in the economy, society and public services. Its first national strategies’ 
review was published in February 2020.

The last step taken by the European Commission, in April 2021, is the launch of the proposal for a European Regulation on AI [2]_ which aims to introduce a
common regulatory and legal framework based on a well-defined risk-based assessment of each field of application. 

The initiative also proposes the introduction
of a European Artificial Intelligence Board, which will encourage national cooperation and ensure that the regulation is respected.

AI is therefore a key priority for the European Union. Italy aims to be aligned with this European priority and integrate
its Strategic Programme within this European approach.

Guiding Principles
--------------

This National Strategic Programme for Artificial Intelligence 
defines a coherent and holistic framework of initiatives to
support the development of a national AI ecosystem. 
Its design is **inspired by five guiding principles**.

1. **Italy’s AI is a European AI**. In line with the EU Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence [3]_, 
   the Italian Strategic Programme stems from the awareness that only through common and coordinated actions Europe will
   be able to compete globally and work towards strategic autonomy. Therefore, this programme reflects
   the four sets of proposals put forward by the 2021 EU Coordinated Plan on AI. First, it sets enabling conditions for AI’s development and uptake by focusing      on cooperation, data and computing infrastructure. Second, it leverages on existing Italian HPC and data-management infrastructure. Third, it aims at        
   nurturing talents and adheres to the joint effort for
   improving and adopting the harmonised set of rules for AI proposed by the AI ACT. Fourth, it identifies priority sectors where to build strategic leadership.

2. **Italy will be a global research and innovation hub of AI.**. 
   [4]_ To guarantee future economic growth and
   strategic autonomy, it is essential for Italy to boost its AI research and development ecosystem and
   leapfrog at the forefront of AI developments. Accordingly, this strategic programme will invest in frontier
   research and applications to develop AI methodologies and techniques of tomorrow.

3. **Italy’s AI will be human-centred, trustworthy and 
   sustainable**. [5]_ Technologies must not promote economic growth per se, but inclusive and sustainable growth, in line with the principles contained in   
   Article 3 of the Italian Constitution and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This means that AI
   development must be centred around economic and social inclusion, human rights as well as environmental sustainability. AI must be designed and implemented in
   a responsible and transparent manner,
   based on trust and robustness so that it can be safely adopted in every sector and be capable of responding to societal challenges. To this aim, Italy adheres
   to the “Ethics Guidelines for trustworthy AI- Guidance
   and implementation program” defined by the High Level Expert Group on AI.

4. **Italian companies will become leaders of AI-based research, 
   development and innovation.**. The digital
   transformation of our entrepreneurial ecosystem is a must, if Italy wants to keep up with the most developed and innovative nations. To that end, this
   programme fosters the development, implementation and
   adoption of AI solutions. Public-private partnerships will be instrumental in finding appropriate synergies
   between research bodies and enterprises with the aim of increasing Italy’s technology transfer capabilities and thus competitiveness. 

5. **Italy’s public administrations will govern with AI and will 
   govern AI.**. [6]_ The use and impact of AI in the
   public sector revolves around the dual dimensions of governance ‘with and of’ AI. On the one hand, Italy’s
   Government will improve its internal processes and policies thanks to a responsible use of data and AI
   technology. On the other hand, the Government is committed to governing AI and mitigating its potential
   risks, especially to safeguard human rights and ensure an ethical deployment of AI. 

These Guiding Principles are not separate pillars. They offer an ambitious vision of the future of AI in Italy and an
integrated approach that aims at stimulating all those factors that can contribute to the development of a favourable
ecosystem. Industrial changes will lead to societal ones and both of these, in turn, will stimulate fundamental and
challenge-driven research. The Strategic Programme is set to support all of these aspects. 

Objectives and Priority Sectors
------------------------------

Given the challenges laid out in the prior chapter, as well as Italy’s competitive position in the field of AI, this strategic
programme lays out six objectives with a view to boosting Italy’s strengths while mitigating its weaknesses.
These objectives are: 

**Objective 1**: Advance frontier research in AI, both fundamental and applied, with a view to generating
impact on important priority sectors of Industry, Public sector, Society, and Environment. A multidisciplinary approach must be incentivized, where research coexists with industrial and social innovation generating true innovation ecosystems.

**Objective 2:** Reduce AI research fragmentation by helping the AI ecosystems achieve critical mass and
by fostering network collaborations, making scientific excellence coexist with social cohesion and territorial inclusiveness.

**Objective 3**: Develop and adopt human-centred and trustworthy AI in the public and private sector,
promoting the societal acceptability of AI solutions, their compliance to regulation of AI, while supporting
the development and design of responsible AI technology and systems.

**Objective 4**: Increase AI-based innovation and the development of AI technology by fostering industrial investments and partnerships that drive excellent
science out to the market, hence facilitating the uptake of AI in SMBs.

**Obiettivo 5**: Develop AI-driven policies and services in the public sector by boosting public sector innovation, the adoption of AI solutions and the
cooperation between research centres, industries, and public bodies. 

**Obiettivo 6**: Create, retain and attract AI talent in Italy by promoting all levels of education in AI, creating a new generation of holistic AI researchers and
innovators, making Italy an attractive AI destination for qualified human capital from abroad, with a particular attention to diversity and gender balance.

Together with this strategy’s **six objectives**, Italy is committed to investing in **eleven priority sectors**. These sectors
include those where Italy already has a competitive advantage, such as manufacturing, culture, agri-food and health,
but also industries that are strategic to the country’s technological development, such as national security, IT and the
environment. 

**Priority sectors**

**Industry and Manufacturing**. AI will enable the Italian manufacturing sector, the second largest in
Europe and seventh largest in the world, to introduce innovative processes, products and business
models to the market while maintaining (or increasing) its global competitive edge. 

**Education system**. As artificial intelligence is transforming every aspect of our lives we need to educate
all people to this technology through a new education and training plan to understand, reinforce,
integrate and disseminate AI technology. AI should be an important topic at all education levels. At the
same time, it can constitute a powerful instrument for a fruitful transformation of the national education
system to develop personalized learning plans while ensuring fairness and trustworthiness.

**Agri-food**. Through AI, Italy’s thriving agri-food sector has the potential to increase further 
its competitive position by developing precision agriculture, thus avoiding overproduction and waste, increasing food
safety and reducing emissions from land and agriculture. 

**Culture and tourism**. Advanced technologies will further increase Italy’s touristic attractiveness by creating 
new synergies between cultural and creative industries, producers, managers and users of Italy’s
vast cultural heritage. These technologies enable, for instance, continuous monitoring and preventive
restoration of cultural heritage, monitoring and alert system for landscape heritage, customisation of
services to better meet demand, virtual tours of tourist destinations to allow for better informed choices
of travel destination, simultaneous translators for the description of places and monuments visited,
geolocalised services for tourists.

**Health and wellbeing**. In the field of healthcare, AI applications boost product and process innovation by
exchanging and aggregating information that is currently scattered in a multitude of public and largely
underused databases. AI applications will help meet the new needs arising from an ageing Italian 
population. Moreover, they will have a significant impact on the population at risk of severe diseases such as
degenerative, oncological, and viral diseases, and increase social inclusion of disadvantaged groups.
A few application examples are medical devices and services in screening and diagnostic areas such as
omics and medical imaging, new drugs and vaccines, tracking and treating people, supporting patient
care (diagnosis and prognosis), and predictive models of healthcare needs.

**Environment, infrastructures and networks**. AI solutions will have a significant impact on preserving
resources, reducing emissions, better managing traffic flows and related risks, strengthening the circular economy and better preventing natural disasters. More
generally, AI will be a fundamental ally in
accelerating the ecological transition, a pillar of Italy’s recovery and resilience plan and European Union’s
recovery efforts. In addition, AI may have an enabling role also in the highly strategic development of 5G
networks as it can help improve network performance as well as reduce capital expenditures associated
with its infrastructure deployment/management . A few application examples are monitoring and intelligent management of networks and consumption, monitoring and
predictive management of the waste
cycle, situational and predictive analysis of hydrogeological instability.

**Banking, Finance, and Insurance**. Modern AI technologies will allow banks and insurers to improve in at
least two ways. First, they will increase the quality of services offered to customers and reduce their
costs through a higher level of personalisation and security of transactions. Second, AI applications will
strengthen fraud prevention systems and simplify the fulfilment of intermediary obligations through the
adoption of mechanisms for detecting suspicious behaviour and analysing data and documents.

**Public Administration**. In the near future, AI will optimise bureaucratic processes, offering better services to citizens and businesses and reducing costs for
better services and performance. Furthermore, with its databases and innovative tools for purchasing, investment and regulation, the PA is called upon
to play an active role in the AI revolution in the private sector for the benefit of the community (e.g. open
data, geolocation tools, purchase of AI products and services, funds for AI, experimentation of AI solutions). The PA could benefit from AI solutions concerning
flow management, virtual assistants and chatbots, predictive analysis of business risks and support for the examination of incentive applications,
support in the fight against tax evasion and other forms of illegality, evaluation of past policies and
impact analysis of experiments.

**Smart cities, areas and communities**. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the digital ecosystem is
essential to support all citizens, whether they live in cities or rural areas. AI will enable Italian residents,
wherever they live, to gain access to communities and services, while reducing costs. Finally, AI technologies will enable Italy to reduce traffic and limit
congestion thus also contributing to reining in the effects of one of the most polluting activities in the country. 
A few examples are smart parking, traffic management and signage control, self-driving vehicle management
systems, lighting management and optimisation of public transport, as well as monitoring of bridges and buildings, home automation for buildings.

**National Security**. The importance of AI for the National Security of a country has been growing steadily
in the last five years. Hence, Italy is fully committed to investing in AI applications that ensure the security of its citizens. This includes individual and
national cybersecurity, where AI has been contributing to the development of new-generation detection and resolution software. 

**Information Technologies**. The success of applications of AI in the sectors described above strongly
depends on a high level of innovations in IT crucial fields impacting AI, such as Sensing, Reasoning and
Search, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Human-AI interaction, and Edge Computing. The
broad field of IT has a crucial role in ensuring a high level of innovation for implementing competitive AI
in all different applications. For this reason, a special effort will be devoted to supporting the birth and
growth of Italian IT companies.
